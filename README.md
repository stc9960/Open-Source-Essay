### Microsoft and the Proprietary Software Model:

  I find Microsoft's combanant behavior to the open source very interesting. Before Microsoft started to develop the proprietary software model, software was shared and passed around freely from computer user to computer user. Source code was a common thing that was shared between people and it could be editted freely. Sadly, this free passing of software did not last very long. At the beginning of 1976, Bill Gate's had a different idea. He wrote a letter to a club called the Homebrew Computer Club, a club made up of hackers, the letter was later published in the January 31st edition of the club newsletter. His letter outlined his grand new idea of proprietary software. Unfortunately, Bill Gates' greed overcame him and the letter was written in a condescending fashion. His so called "Open Letter to Hobbyists" letter also outlines his frustrations with the open source and passing around of software culture. His main motivator of frustration reads:
  > "The feedback we have gotten from the hundreds of people who say they are using BASIC has all been positive. Two surprising things are apparent, however. 1) Most of these "users" never bought BASIC (Less than 10% of all Altair owners have bought BASIC), and 2) The amount of royalties we have recieved from sales to hobbyists makes the time spent of Altair BASIC worth less than $2 an hour."
